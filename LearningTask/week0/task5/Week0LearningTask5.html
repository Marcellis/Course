                    <h3>Prepare for the oral essessment</h3>

                    <br> A prerequisite for taking part in the Oral Asessment is having both assigments marked with sufficient. The exam will take 15 Minutes per person. During the assessment questions are asked about the coding. The goal is to determine if you actually understand your code.
                    <br> <br> The teachers will use your solution of assignment two.  You can expand your app until the oral exam to improve your mark but please make sure you have at all time a working app in which you can fall back on. You need a running app in order to be allowed to enter the oral exam room.
                <br>
