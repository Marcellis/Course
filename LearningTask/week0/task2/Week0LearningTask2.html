                To pass this course you need to complete two assignments during the course. Finishing these assignments is necessary to get your ticket for the oral assessment. You can find below more information about the assignments and the Oral Assessment.

                <br>
                <h3>Assignments (pass or fail) - individually </h3> In week 3 you start with your first assignment, and in week 5 with your second. Both assigments have to be marked (pass or fail) by the teacher.
                 <br>
                 For more information about the requirements of the first assignment:

                <br>
                <br> For more information about the requirements of the second assignment:

                <h3>Oral Assessment (grade) - individually</h3> 
                
                
                A prerequisite for taking part in the Oral Asessment is having both assigments marked with a pass. 
                The exam will take 15 minutes per person. During the assessment questions are asked about the coding. We will use your solution of assigment two for the assessment.
                 The goal is to determine if you actually understand your code and to determine your level of competency.

                <br> During the oral assessment we will use this rubric:
